Men of the North, you stand at the precipice; your kings have failed you. So now you turn to the gods. And yet you do not plead, you do not kneel to dust your heads with ash. Instead, you wail, Why have the gods forsaken us? We must look into the trials we failed long ago. In a time past, our world intertwined with another through an upheaval scholars call the Conjunction of the Spheres. The gods allowed unholy forces to slip into our domain. The offspring of that cataclysm was the nefarious force called magic. Yet we did not banish it. Instead, we studied the arcane for our own power and wealth. And the monsters at our door--the unholy relics of this conjunction, the trolls, the corpse eaters. Did we raise our swords against them? Or have we laid this burden on others, on so-called witches? Stray children taught the ways of foul sorcery, their bodies mutated through blasphemous ritual, sent to fight monsters, though they could not distinguish good from evil. The flicker of humanity long extinguished within them. Yes, their numbers have dwindled through the years, but a few still roam our lands, offering their bloody work for coin. To this day, they shame us with their very existence. The North bleeds, flogged by war. The battles are the gods' whip, chastisement for our sins. Let us not forget the terrors; the scourge is from beyond our world. The Wild Hunt rides the sky with every full moon. The dark raiders abduct our children into lands unknown. Some say they herald a second conjunction. Can we chart a course back into the light? Will we find the strength to banish the mages from our kingdoms, unite around the warmth of the eternal fire?

        "Monologue": "Used to be, when people talked about the end of the world, we locked them up or laughed them off, sometimes both, but we never took them seriously. Maybe we should have. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Better to start at the beginning, with the abduction of Desmond Miles, my son. This boy had no ambition, no direction, no plans for the future. What he did have was a heritage, one he chose to deny. It nearly cost him his life. He was captured and imprisoned. Those who took him believed he could help them find something--the Apple, one of several artifacts we call Pieces of Eden, bits of ancient technology scattered across the globe. Some hidden, some found, all of them dangerous. Most are held by a single group, the same group that now had Desmond. You know them as Abstergo Industries. We know them as the Templars, as the enemy. We've been fighting them for thousands of years, even longer if you believe the stories of their origins. I do, after all I've seen.  The truth, that's the beauty and the horror of the Animus, a device that allows us to enter and experience the lives of our ancestors. It holds the power to change everything, to show us history the way it really happened. Up until its creation, to the victor went the spoils, went the truth. We're trying to fix that, to free minds and bodies both, but there's only so much that we can do, and the Templars have the upper hand these days. But something larger than the Assassins and Templars is approaching, bigger than all of us, and if we can't find a way to stop it, these next few weeks will probably be our last, everyone's last. In the end, it all comes down to him, to Desmond. Through the Animus, he discovered his heritage, explored the lives of his ancestors, and uncovered their secrets. When that was done, he trained; he used another ancestor to provide decades of experience in the span of a few days. It worked, we think, we hope. Soon, though, soon we'll know.  That ominous date fast approaches--December 21st, 2012. None of us knows what it'll bring, only that this is where they want us to be when it does. They've been guiding us in their own fractured, frustrating way. These voices from the first civilization, the ones who came before, a precursor race of immense power and uncertain motives. They're the ones who made the Pieces of Eden. This is where they've led him, and through him, us. He stands at the entrance to this long-lost place, armed with the knowledge of Altair and the abilities of Ezio. He holds in his hands the Apple of Eden, and we stand at his side, ready to support him however we can. His name is Desmond Miles, and he has brought us to the end.",
        "Context": "In \"Assassin's Creed III\", the introductory monologue is delivered by William Miles, setting the stage for the game's narrative. He reflects on the end of the world, a concept once dismissed but now frighteningly real. The story begins with the abduction of Desmond Miles, his son, who possesses a denied heritage.

Players take on the role of Desmond Miles, using the Animus to explore the lives of his ancestors and uncover hidden truths about the Assassins and Templars. As Desmond, players must gain the knowledge and skills of his ancestors, Altair and Ezio, to prevent an impending apocalypse foretold to occur on December 21, 2012. The journey involves mastering combat and stealth, solving complex puzzles, and making strategic decisions that impact the course of history. Armed with the Apple of Eden and supported by his fellow Assassins, Desmond stands at the brink of the final confrontation, ready to use his newfound abilities to save humanity from disaster."

        "Game": "Dragon Age: Origins",
        "Monologue": "The Chantry teaches us that it is the hubris of men which brought the darkspawn into our world. The mages sought to usurp heaven, but instead, they destroyed it. They were cast out, twisted, and cursed by their own corruption. They returned as monsters, the first of the darkspawn. They became a blight upon the lands--unstoppable and relentless. The Dwarven kingdoms were the first to fall, and from the Deep Roads, the darkspawn drove at us again and again until finally, we neared annihilation.  To the Grey Wardens came men and women from every race--warriors and mages, barbarians and kings. The Grey Wardens sacrificed everything to stem the tide of darkspawn and prevail. It has been four centuries since that victory, and we have kept our vigil. We have watched and waited for the darkspawn to return, but those who once called us heroes have forgotten. We are few now, and our warnings have been ignored for too long. It may be too late, for I have seen with my own eyes what lies on the horizon.  Maker help us.",
        "Context": "In \"Dragon Age: Origins\", the introductory monologue is delivered by Duncan, a senior member of the Grey Wardens. This sets the stage for the game's epic fantasy narrative.
