Employee Number 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427, and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month and every year, and although others might have considered it soul-rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy.  And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley. Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No-one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say Hi. Never in all his years at the company had this happened - this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office",
        "Context": "In <TITLE>The Stanley Parable</TITLE>, the introductory monologue sets the stage for the game's narrative. The player takes on the role of Stanley, an office worker who discovers that his colleagues have mysteriously vanished. As Stanley, the player navigates the deserted office, making choices that impact the story's direction. The game explores themes of free will, control, and the nature of decision-making, with the player's actions leading to various endings, all while a narrator comments on and sometimes reacts to Stanley's choices."

        "Monologue": "Twelve dreams for the Red Queen under crown of stone. Eight voracious beasts born from eight restless nights. Four nails piercing the flesh of the sinner. One prayer for the summoned, called by this song. It is perhaps the countdown to oblivion for the once proud city of London. 'Tis perchance her inhabitants' last dance, alone to face death and pestilence, confronted by the eerie and unknown. Mortals became desperate for answers. A flock's flight makes for an omen, the falling of a star a dire presage. Turning to priests for interpretation, when there was no reason to be found, when religion failed, men turned to science. I saw them build such vain cities, crafting machines made for endless war. New questions flourished as old answers withered. What is darkness but lurking sunlight? What is war but enslaved stone? What is glass but tortured sand? What is song but a call to arms? What is hate but jilted love? What is life but death pending?",
        "Context": "In <TITLE>Vampyr</TITLE>, the introductory monologue sets the tone for the game's dark and atmospheric narrative. The player takes on the role of Dr. Jonathan Reid, a renowned surgeon in early 20th-century London who is transformed into a vampire amidst a deadly flu epidemic. Struggling with his new supernatural condition, Jonathan must find a balance between his duty to save the citizens as a doctor and his uncontrollable thirst for blood. As he navigates the eerie, plague-ridden streets of London, Jonathan uncovers dark secrets and faces moral dilemmas that challenge his humanity. The game explores themes of life, death, and redemption, with the player's choices deeply influencing the fate of the city's inhabitants and Jonathan's own destiny.       "

        "Monologue": "War. War never changes. Since the dawn of humankind, when our ancestors first discovered the killing power of rock and bone, blood has been spilled in the name of everything from God to justice to simple psychotic rage. In the year 2077, after millennia of armed conflict, the destructive nature of man could sustain itself no longer. The world was plunged into an abyss of nuclear fire and radiation. But it was not the end of the world. Instead, the apocalypse was simply the prologue to another bloody chapter of human history. For man had succeeded in destroying the world, but war never changes.  In the early days, thousands were spared the horrors of the Holocaust by taking refuge in enormous underground shelters known as vaults. But when they emerged, they had only the hell of the wastes to greet them, except those in Vault 101. For on that fateful day, when fire rained from the sky, the giant steel door of Vault 101 slid closed and never reopened. It was here you were born; it is here you will die. Because in Vault 101, no one ever enters, and no one ever leaves.      ",

        "Monologue": "The fallen leaves tell a story: the great Elden Ring was shattered. In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found. On the Night of the Black Knives, Godwin the Golden was the first to perish. Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.

The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all--chieftain of the badlands, the ever-brilliant Goldmask, Fia the deathbed companion, the loathsome Dung Eater, and one other whom grace would again bless.
