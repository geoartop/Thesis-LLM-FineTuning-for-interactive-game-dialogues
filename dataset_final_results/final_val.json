        "Monologue": "War, war never changes. The end of the world occurred pretty much as we'd predicted: too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless; the reasons, as always, purely human. Once, the earth was nearly wiped clean of life--a great cleansing. The atomic spark, dropped by human hands, quickly raged out of control. Spears of nuclear fire rained from the skies, continents were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. Humanity was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the background radiation that blanketed the earth. A quiet darkness fell across the planet, lasting many years. Few survived the devastation. Some had been fortunate enough to reach safety, taking shelter in great underground vaults. When the great darkness passed, these vaults opened, and their inhabitants emerged to begin their lives again.  One of the northern tribes claims they are descended from one such vault. They hold that their founder and ancestor, one known as the Vault Dweller, once saved the world from a great evil. According to their legend, this evil arose in the far south. It corrupted all it touched, twisting men inside, turning them into beasts. Only through the bravery of this Vault Dweller was the evil destroyed. But in so doing, he lost many of his friends and suffered greatly, sacrificing much of himself to save the world. When at last he returned to the home he had fought so hard to protect, he was cast out, exiled, confronting that which they feared he had become, something else in their eyes, no longer their champion.  Forsaken by his people, he strode into the wasteland. He traveled far to the north until he came to the great canyons, where he founded a small village, Arroyo, where he lived out the rest of his years. And so, for a generation since its founding, Arroyo has lived in peace, its canyons sheltering it from the outside world. It is home, your home. But the scars left by the war have not yet healed, and the earth has not forgotten.",
        "Context": "In \"Fallout 2,\" the introductory monologue is delivered by a narrator who reflects on the unchanging nature of war and the catastrophic events that led to the world's near-destruction. This sets the stage for the game's post-apocalyptic narrative, where players take on the role of the Chosen One, a descendant of the legendary Vault Dweller. Emerging from the tribal village of Arroyo, the player embarks on a perilous journey to save their home from ecological disaster. The story unfolds in a vast, irradiated wasteland filled with mutated creatures, ruthless factions, and remnants of pre-war technology. As the Chosen One, players must navigate this dangerous world, making crucial decisions that will determine the fate of their tribe and the future of humanity."

        "Monologue": "War. War never changes. Since the dawn of humankind, when our ancestors first discovered the killing power of rock and bone, blood has been spilled in the name of everything from God to justice to simple psychotic rage. In the year 2077, after millennia of armed conflict, the destructive nature of man could sustain itself no longer. The world was plunged into an abyss of nuclear fire and radiation. But it was not the end of the world. Instead, the apocalypse was simply the prologue to another bloody chapter of human history. For man had succeeded in destroying the world, but war never changes.  In the early days, thousands were spared the horrors of the Holocaust by taking refuge in enormous underground shelters known as vaults. But when they emerged, they had only the hell of the wastes to greet them, except those in Vault 101. For on that fateful day, when fire rained from the sky, the giant steel door of Vault 101 slid closed and never reopened. It was here you were born; it is here you will die. Because in Vault 101, no one ever enters, and no one ever leaves.      ",

        "Game": "Alan Wake",
        "Monologue": "Stephen King once wrote that nightmares exist outside of logic, and there's little fun to be had in explanations; they're antithetical to the poetry of fear. In a horror story, the victim keeps asking why, but there can be no explanation and there shouldn't be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest and is what we'll remember in the end. My name is Alan Wake. I'm a writer. I've always had a vivid imagination, but this dream unsettled me. It was wild and dark and weird, even by my standards.  So yes, it began with a dream, following a typical nightmare pattern. I was late, desperately trying to reach my destination, a lighthouse, for some urgent reason I couldn't remember. I had been driving too fast down a coastal road to get there. I'd seen the hitchhiker too late. He was dead. I was convinced they'd put me in jail and I would never see Alice again. Suddenly, his body was gone. I was in shock from the crash. I could hardly stand on my feet.",
