Finally, mankind had prevailed against the disease, but people always want more. Despite a promise to shutter its labs, the GRE continued its research in secrecy for military purposes.  It didn't take long for a variant of the Hurran virus to escape into the world once more. The fall happened more rapidly than anyone could have predicted. The few who survived now live in small enclaves. The only means of contact between distant human settlements are lone individuals, brave or desperate enough to travel on their own across dangerous wastelands. They are known as pilgrims. Somewhere on the map, one city is still standing, a city isolated from the outside world, a city with special rules.  Now, it's the last bastion of humanity, a chance for us to learn from history and, for once, make the right choices because every choice you make here shapes the future irreversibly.",

Civilization has collapsed due to a new variant of the Hurran virus, which spread rapidly after escaping from secret military research labs. Now, the remnants of humanity live in small enclaves, with one last city standing as a bastion of hope. This city is isolated, governed by unique rules, and represents humanity's final chance to learn from past mistakes. The game explores themes of survival, choice, and consequence, as every decision Aiden makes shapes the future of this fragile society. The player must navigate the city, forge alliances, and face threats both human and infected to determine the fate of humanity."

        "Monologue": "You asked me once about this memory. I lied. I told you it was lost. I worried the wrong lesson would be learned. But this man lived many lives and he has much to teach us. Of course, when he came to us, he was little more than a common thief, scrambling to survive on the streets of Baghdad, dreaming of a better future not just for himself but for all those he saw suffering on the margins. For while he lived in a golden age at the heart and the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, scratch its gilded surface and you'd find a rot beneath.  The Order of the Ancients fought to rise and spread their cruelty through the land. The Hidden Ones, as we were known then, resisted, striking at our enemy from the shadows in an eternal struggle. Centuries ago, he was at its heart. He honored the Creed, he challenged it--so must we. We have it in all of us to mistake the shadows we walk for the light we serve. The time may come when we will be tested as he was. I fear that time is coming soon. Thank you.",

        "Monologue": "So you want to hear another story, one where the very fate of Pandora hangs in the balance? If not, too bad, I'm telling you anyway. First, there was the Vault, an alien prison opened with a mystical key. To the warriors opening the Vault, it was just a container of tentacles and disappointment. They vanished into the wastelands, certain that the Vault held no treasure at all. They were wrong. The Vault's opening triggered the growth of Eridium, a priceless alien element. Soon, the rare and valuable mineral emerged all across Pandora. Its appearance attracted many, including the Hyperion Corporation. They came to Pandora to mine Eridium and bring order to the savage planet. Through their excavations, Hyperion uncovered evidence of an even greater Vault. Their leader vowed to find it, to use its power to civilize the Borderlands once and for all. But Hyperion weren't the only ones searching for the next Vault.
