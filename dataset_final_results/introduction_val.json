        "Monologue": "Civilization is a vulnerable thing, a whim of circumstance. At any time, the smallest flap of a butterfly's wings may set catastrophe in motion. Iran, an entire city, was wiped from the map. Those left behind there did not stand a chance. The world's greatest minds came together and found a vaccine against the Hurran virus. Finally, mankind had prevailed against the disease, but people always want more. Despite a promise to shutter its labs, the GRE continued its research in secrecy for military purposes.  It didn't take long for a variant of the Hurran virus to escape into the world once more. The fall happened more rapidly than anyone could have predicted. The few who survived now live in small enclaves. The only means of contact between distant human settlements are lone individuals, brave or desperate enough to travel on their own across dangerous wastelands. They are known as pilgrims. Somewhere on the map, one city is still standing, a city isolated from the outside world, a city with special rules.  Now, it's the last bastion of humanity, a chance for us to learn from history and, for once, make the right choices because every choice you make here shapes the future irreversibly.",

        "Game": "Assassins Creed: Mirage",
        "Monologue": "You asked me once about this memory. I lied. I told you it was lost. I worried the wrong lesson would be learned. But this man lived many lives and he has much to teach us. Of course, when he came to us, he was little more than a common thief, scrambling to survive on the streets of Baghdad, dreaming of a better future not just for himself but for all those he saw suffering on the margins. For while he lived in a golden age at the heart and the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, scratch its gilded surface and you'd find a rot beneath.  The Order of the Ancients fought to rise and spread their cruelty through the land. The Hidden Ones, as we were known then, resisted, striking at our enemy from the shadows in an eternal struggle. Centuries ago, he was at its heart. He honored the Creed, he challenged it--so must we. We have it in all of us to mistake the shadows we walk for the light we serve. The time may come when we will be tested as he was. I fear that time is coming soon. Thank you.",

First, there was the Vault, an alien prison opened with a mystical key. To the warriors opening the Vault, it was just a container of tentacles and disappointment.

Soon, the rare and valuable mineral emerged all across Pandora. Its appearance attracted many, including the Hyperion Corporation.
