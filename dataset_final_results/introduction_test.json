        "Game": "Alan Wake",
        "Monologue": "Stephen King once wrote that nightmares exist outside of logic, and there's little fun to be had in explanations; they're antithetical to the poetry of fear. In a horror story, the victim keeps asking why, but there can be no explanation and there shouldn't be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest and is what we'll remember in the end. My name is Alan Wake. I'm a writer. I've always had a vivid imagination, but this dream unsettled me. It was wild and dark and weird, even by my standards.  So yes, it began with a dream, following a typical nightmare pattern. I was late, desperately trying to reach my destination, a lighthouse, for some urgent reason I couldn't remember. I had been driving too fast down a coastal road to get there. I'd seen the hitchhiker too late. He was dead. I was convinced they'd put me in jail and I would never see Alice again. Suddenly, his body was gone. I was in shock from the crash. I could hardly stand on my feet.",

        "Monologue": "The Chantry teaches us that it is the hubris of men which brought the darkspawn into our world. The mages sought to usurp heaven, but instead, they destroyed it. They were cast out, twisted, and cursed by their own corruption. They returned as monsters, the first of the darkspawn. They became a blight upon the lands--unstoppable and relentless. The Dwarven kingdoms were the first to fall, and from the Deep Roads, the darkspawn drove at us again and again until finally, we neared annihilation.  To the Grey Wardens came men and women from every race--warriors and mages, barbarians and kings. The Grey Wardens sacrificed everything to stem the tide of darkspawn and prevail. It has been four centuries since that victory, and we have kept our vigil. We have watched and waited for the darkspawn to return, but those who once called us heroes have forgotten. We are few now, and our warnings have been ignored for too long. It may be too late, for I have seen with my own eyes what lies on the horizon.  Maker help us.",

        "Game": "Darkest Dungeon",
        "Monologue": "Ruin has come to our family. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor-shadowed manor, bathed in decadence and luxury. And yet, I began to tire of conventional extravagance. Singular, unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long-buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels.  At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness. I fled laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity until consciousness failed me.

        "Monologue": "laudia, my dearest sister, I have been in Arra a week now, safe and in high spirits but prepared for the worst. The men and women who have fed and sheltered me here also give me warning that the road to Masaf is overrun by mercenaries and bandits not native to this land. What this could mean, I had dread to guess when I first set out from Roma 10 months ago. I did so with a single purpose: to discover what our father did not. In a letter written the year before my birth, he makes mention of a library hidden beneath the stones of Masia Castle, a sanctum full of invaluable wisdom.  So, what will I find when I arrive there? Who will greet me? I host an eager Templar, as I fear most strongly, or nothing but the whistling of a cold and lonely wind. Masaf has not been home to the Assassins for almost 300 years now. Can we still claim it for our own? Are we welcome there? Ah, I am wary of this fight, Claudia, not because I am tired, but because our struggle seems to move in one direction only: towards chaos. Today, I have more questions than answers.  This is why I've come so far: to find clarity, to find the wisdom left behind by the great Aler so that I may better understand the purpose of our fight and my place in it. Should anything happen to me, Claudia, should my skills fail me or my ambition lead me astray, do not seek retribution or revenge in my memory, but fight to continue the search for truth so that all may benefit. My story is one of many thousands, and the world will not suffer if it ends too soon.",
