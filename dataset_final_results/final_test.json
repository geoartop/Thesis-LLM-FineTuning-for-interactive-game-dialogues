        "Monologue": "War has changed. It's no longer about nations, ideologies, or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles fought by mercenaries and machines. War, and its consumption of life, has become a well-oiled machine.  ID-tagged soldiers carry ID-tagged weapons, use ID-tagged gear. Nanomachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Genetic control, information control, emotion control, battlefield control--everything is monitored and kept under control.  War has changed. The age of deterrence has become the age of control, all in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction. And he who controls the battlefield controls history. When the battlefield is under total control, war becomes routine.  Get him! Keep up the bra! Get back, get back! We're going in! Follow, ground, return fire! Watch out from above! Chopper, we're surrounded, damn it, they've got us surrounded! We're being followed, use the RPGs! Everyone, keep cool! Get over there! Just keep moving, boys!",

        "Monologue": "In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons. But then there was Fire and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark. Then from the dark, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame. Nito, the First of the Dead, The Witch of Izalith and her Daughters of Chaos, Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten.  With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons. Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales. The Witches weaved great firestorms. Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease. And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more.  Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights. And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign.  Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead. And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate.",

Pandora, this is our home, but make no mistake, this is not a planet of peace and love. They say it's a wasteland, that it's dangerous, that only a fool would search for something of value here. Then perhaps I am a fool. But do not be fooled by what Pandora appears to be. There was a legend, many people tell it: the legend of the Vault. My father would always go on about the Vault, even with his dying breath. Advanced alien technology, infinite wealth, fame, power, women.

        "Monologue": "Eora: a world where mortals live, die, and are reborn through the turning of the Wheel, the cycle of reincarnation is watched over by the gods and made possible through pillars of a mystical substance known as adra. Five years ago, you traveled from your home to the Deerwood, a nation that had waged war against the incarnated God of Light, Eothas, resulting in his destruction. The country suffered from a plague of Hollowborn infants, born without souls, a tragedy many believed was punishment for killing a god. In an ancient, secluded ruin, you witnessed a secret ritual that inadvertently transformed you into a Watcher, one who can see and speak with souls. This ritual also gave you horrible visions--waking nightmares of a past life that threatened your sanity. To put them to rest, you pursued the man who had led the ritual, a seemingly immortal agent of the gods known as Thaos Ix Arkannon. With divine assistance, you confronted and defeated Thaos, ending your visions and resolving the Hollowborn crisis. In so doing, you also learned the great secret that Thaos had protected: that the ancient empire of Engwith had transformed themselves into gods. Your visions finally put to rest, you retired to the castle of Caed Nua, built atop a massive statue of pure adra, where you ruled in relative peace and prosperity.  Made a nice story. You fixing up that old keep, lifting the curse. Must \u2018ve told it a hundred times. But ... something got to gnawin' at me... Thinkin' the spirits there were not really at rest.

        "Monologue": "War. War never changes. The Romans waged war to gather slaves and wealth. Spain built an empire from its lust for gold and territory. Hitler shaped a battered Germany into an economic superpower.  But war never changes.  In the 21st century, war was still waged over the resources that could be acquired. Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons: Petroleum and Uranium. For these resources, China would invade Alaska, the US would annex Canada, and the European Commonwealth would dissolve into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last remaining resources on Earth.  In 2077, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise.  A few were able to reach the relative safety of the large underground Vaults. Your family was part of that group that entered Vault Thirteen. Imprisoned safely behind the large Vault door, under a mountain of stone, a generation has lived without knowledge of the outside world.  Life in the Vault is about to change",
        "Context": "In \"Fallout\", the introductory monologue delivered by the narrator, sets the stage for the game's post-apocalyptic narrative.

However, the Vault's water purification chip fails, and the player is tasked with venturing into the dangerous, irradiated wasteland to find a replacement.

The player's actions and decisions will shape the future of the wasteland and determine the fate of humanity's remnants."
